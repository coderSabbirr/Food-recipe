                <h3>Calabasa soup</h3>
                <p>Although this pumpkin soup recipe makes use of calabaza squash, you can use other varieties of
                    pumpkin depending on your preference. I used kalabasa for this recipe because it tastes sweeter
                    compared to ordinary pumpkin. It is also a good source of Vitamin A..</p>
